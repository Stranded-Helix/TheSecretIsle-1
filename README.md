# TheSecretIsle

# Topic 
This application is an intuitive game that allows the user to progress through a story and make a decision based on the current situation at hand. As the user progresses through the game and makes decisions, the outcome is altered as metrics behind the scenes are being tracked based on the user's choices.

The current version of the application is a conceptual template for an organizational management tool.

The work environment is rapidly evolving. We need a new, improved, and easy way to train and develop teams from entry level positions to executive leadership.

## Future Development Outline
The goal of this application is to be turned into an Organizational Management Tool. 

This application would allow team members to answer a series of questions in which responses are evaluated to measure seven key management and leadership areas. 

The results would provide a roadmap of interests and strengths to be used for evaluation, development, and coaching of the individual with a clear focus on specific objectives. 
 
These results can then be aggregated across a team or organization to evaluate corporate culture, assess their corporate strengths, as well as potential areas of development for the team or organization.  

### 7 Key Metric Areas:

- Time Management
- Interpersonal Skills
- Communication Skills
- Decision Making
- Teamwork
- Critical Thinking

Because these (7) key areas are being evaluated, this also allows leadership to pursue applicable further assessments  and improvements by choosing specific disciplines, or areas of skills-based training for a greater and more precise impact on team effectiveness and cooperation. 

This  with data-driven evaluation, and subsequent focus on common language, values, and corporate culture has significant potential to result in higher team satisfaction, longer terms of retention, and greater productivity.

With the rapidly changing work environment we are currently experiencing during and post-pandemic, it is imperative we begin new initiatives to help grow and develop the current workplace and corporate world.
